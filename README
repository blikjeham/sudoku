Sudoku solver

The goal for this program is to see if I could build a sudoku solver. If I can solve a sudoku, would I be clever enough to convert my method of solving the sudokus into a computer program.

I try to make the program as simple as possible, yet as smart as possible.
Later on I will make additions to it. Build in more and more algorithms for solving the sudoku.

SOLVING:
How do we solve a sudoku?
There are a lot of different possibilities for solving, but here are the steps this program takes:
1) read the field from 'fields.sud'
2) set all possibilities where there is no value to ALL (0x1FF)
3) everewhere there is a value: remove the value from the possibilities in the same block, row, and column (we call that BRC).
4) if there is only one possibility left in a cell, set the value to that possibility.
5) repeat step 3 and 4 until no possibilities are removed
6) check for a single possibility within a BRC.
7) repeat steps 3 to 6
8) check for twice the same possibility within a BRC. Remove the possibility from the other BRC's.
9) repeat steps 3 to 8
10) check for n times the same n possibilities within a BRC. For example twice a 1 and 2 in the same row means that neither 1 or 2 may occur in the same row apart from where they were found.
11) repeat steps 3 to 10
12) if no solution is found, give up.
